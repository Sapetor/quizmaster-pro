### 2. Per-Question Analytics (`calculateQuestionAnalytics()`)
Each question now includes:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of correct answers
- **Response Time Analysis**: Average, median, speed categorization
- **Wrong Answer Patterns**: Most common incorrect answers and frequencies
- **Difficulty-Adjusted Performance**: Success rate weighted by question difficulty
- **Learning Insights**: Automated recommendations based on performance data

### 3. Question Metadata Extraction (`extractQuestionMetadata()`)
Captures comprehensive question details:
- Question text, type, difficulty, time limits
- Correct answers formatted for all question types
- Question complexity scoring
- Image presence, text length, option counts

### 4. Game-Level Metrics (`calculateGameMetrics()`)
Provides overall assessment:
- Completion rates and participation statistics
- Score distribution analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Game duration tracking
- Automated game-level insights and recommendations

### 5. Enhanced CSV Export
- **Analytics-focused CSV**: Per-question performance summary
- **Learning insights included**: Primary recommendations for each question
