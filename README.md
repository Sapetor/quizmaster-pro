```

### Network Settings
The server binds to `0.0.0.0` by default, making it accessible from any device on your local network. This is safe for local use but shouldn't be exposed to the internet.

- True/False questions
- Image-based questions
- Text input questions

### Styling
Modify `public/styles.css` to change:
- Colors and themes
- Fonts and layouts
- Animations and effects

### Game Logic
Update `public/script.js` to adjust:
- Scoring algorithms
- Timer settings
- Game flow

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect from Other Devices
1. Check that all devices are on the same WiFi network

3. Temporarily disable firewall on the host computer
4. Try a different port if 3000 is blocked

### Game Not Loading
1. Ensure Node.js is installed correctly
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Check for any error messages in the terminal
4. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000` first

### Players Can't Join
