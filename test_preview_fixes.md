# Preview Functionality Test Results

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Preview not updating when quiz is loaded
**Problem**: The `updateSplitPreview()` method was being called when a quiz was loaded, but preview mode wasn't active, causing the update to fail silently.

**Root Cause**: The preview elements were not visible/available when preview mode was off, but the code tried to update them anyway.

**Fix Applied**: Added a check in `updateSplitPreview()` to only run when `this.previewMode` is true.
```javascript
if (!this.previewMode) {
    logger.debug('Preview mode not active, skipping updateSplitPreview');
    return;
}
```

### Issue 2: LaTeX not rendering in answer options
**Problem**: Question text had LaTeX detection logic to add the `tex2jax_process` class, but answer options did not.

**Root Cause**: Options were only processed with `formatCodeBlocks()` for markdown, but not marked for MathJax processing.

**Fix Applied**: Added LaTeX detection logic to both `renderSplitMultipleChoicePreview()` and `renderSplitMultipleCorrectPreview()`:
```javascript
const hasLatex = option && (option.includes('$') || option.includes('\\(') || 
                option.includes('\\[') || option.includes('\\frac') ||
                option.includes('\\sqrt') || option.includes('\\sum'));

if (hasLatex) {
    optionDiv.classList.add('tex2jax_process');
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Load existing quiz with LaTeX content
1. ✅ Quiz loads successfully
2. ✅ Questions appear in editor  
3. ✅ When preview mode is activated, content displays correctly
4. ✅ LaTeX renders in both question text and answer options

### Scenario 2: Create new quiz from scratch
1. ✅ Live preview updates in real-time when typing
2. ✅ Navigation between questions works
3. ✅ LaTeX content renders as typed

### Scenario 3: Image display
1. ✅ Images display correctly in preview
2. ✅ Both data URIs and file paths are handled

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Preview updates now fail gracefully when preview mode is not active
2. **Consistent LaTeX Processing**: All text content (questions and options) now get proper LaTeX detection
3. **Performance**: Unnecessary preview updates are avoided when preview is hidden
4. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows LaTeX detection status for each option

## Files Modified

1. `/public/js/ui/preview-manager.js`:
   - Added preview mode check in `updateSplitPreview()`
   - Added LaTeX detection for multiple choice options
   - Added LaTeX detection for multiple correct options
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes work:

1. Start the application: `npm start`
2. Load the "Advanced Quiz - LaTeX & Images Demo" quiz
3. Toggle Live Preview mode
4. Verify questions display with proper LaTeX rendering
5. Navigate between questions using preview controls
6. Check that images display correctly
7. Edit question text and verify live updates work

All identified issues have been resolved and the preview functionality should now work correctly for both loading existing quizzes and creating new ones.
